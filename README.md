# Bigram-Character-Level-Predictor-Using-Statistics
This statistical character predictor model takes large amount of names and tries to predict the next character given a probabilistic model of charcater pairs. Simply, it predicts the probability of the next character given the previous charcater by analyzing the charcater pair probabilities in a text. It obviously is a very bad model with respect to results but it is a valuable practice nontheless.
